This RPG project lets players create and customize a character from four classes: Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Cleric, each with unique stat growth in strength, magic, and health. The stat formulas were designed for balance and simplicity, scaling linearly by level so players can easily track progress. It includes features like saving and loading character data, leveling up, and displaying a formatted character sheet. AI (ChatGPT) assisted with file structure and stat formula ideas, but all code logic and understanding were completed by me
